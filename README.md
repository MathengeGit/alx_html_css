This project is a from-scratch implementation of a fully functional webpage designed using Figma. The goal is to translate a Figma design into a real webpage using only HTML and CSS, with no external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

ðŸš€ Objective
The primary objective is to implement a web page that matches the design provided in the Figma file as closely as possible, focusing on:

HTML semantics
CSS styling and layout
Accessibility
Responsive design
ðŸŽ¨ Design
The original design was created by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. You can view and duplicate the Figma design using this link: Figma Project.

All visual and layout decisions are based on the Figma mockup. The fonts and design details are carefully replicated, while considering some practical adjustments due to browser rendering differences.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
Semantic HTML structure for improved accessibility and SEO.
Pure CSS layout using modern techniques like Flexbox for responsive and flexible designs.
Mobile-first design approach to ensure the page is fully responsive across various devices.
Custom fonts used: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT.
